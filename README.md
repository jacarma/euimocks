# Euimocks

This project is a demo about how to mock Eui components in your app so your snapshots are not messed up when eui changes.

Please have a look at:

- `eui-mock.tsx`: file that returns the Eui components mocked
- `custom-container.spec.tsx`: demo about how to use the mocks
- `__snapshots__/custom-container.spec.tsx.snap`: how the snapshots look like with and without mocks
